food<li> is a recipe search/grocery list app for busy individuals who have to manage/plan the food and meals for their household.


I used javascript for the bulk of my code, with some AJAX for delete/posting functionalities with the My Recipes and My Shopping List pages. I also used some sequelize calls to the database to filter the data for the My Shopping List.


Oustanding issues-in-progress:

- results overlay readability
- Home page with directions
- Delete buttons for ingredients
- Delete-all button for ingredients?
- Validations(?)
- Responsive pages
- stalling on no input for ing
